Hi, and thanks for examining this XP Kata! 

It's worth mentioning that the built project is not a complete and functional vending machine, as a User Interface is missing.

Instead, I wrote the machine's model and control structures only, and sufficient tests to exercise these portions.  

So, the default build script just compiles and runs automated tests.  To see this happen, go into the "gradle" directory of the project and just run "gradle".  The test results will then be in: gradle/build/reports.

If you'd like a built JAR for whatever reason, you can also say "gradle build" and then find the jar in the: /gradle/build/libs folder.

For any help or with questions, please contact <connor.shaughnessy@gmail.com>.
